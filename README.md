While studying about time series analysis in python, I became curious about the decomposition of deterministic components, predictive and forecasting model in the time series model.

I decided to work with USD/RUB exchange rate; I was interested in investigating if the effect of the war and monetary policy will be captured as a residual component.

In addition, I was eager to know if my machine would predict the exchange rate while the data was not stationary.
